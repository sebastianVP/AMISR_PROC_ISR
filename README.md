# PROCESAMIENTO RADAR AMISR-14 
---
# ISR OFF-LINE

In this repository, we will develop the data processing script for the AMISR-14 Radar in daytime mode for the ISR Experiment.
We will test the procesing structure by implementing the reading unit, operations in the time and frequency domains and the parameters unit.
After this, the data merging will be performed, and finally, the plotting.

1. We will test the readint unit.
